# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview
Amazing Prime is the world’s largest video streaming platform, the team at Amazing Prime would like us to develop an algorithm that determines which movie releases will become most popular. In order to do so, the team has decided to sponsor a Hackathon, wherein the movie data is provided, and the participants must create an algorithm to predict the top movie. 

## Purpose
A member of the Amazing Prime team has tasked us to extract movie data from Wikipedia as well as rating data from the Movie Land’s website for the hackathon; transform and clean the data into a singular dataset; and load the dataset into an SQL table. In order to carry out this ETL process we will be using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and SQL. Additionally, they have also asked us to keep this dataset updated on a daily basis; in order to do so we have created an automated pipeline that assesses the fresh data, makes any necessary transformations, and updates the data into the existing table.
